# ATM-Simulator-System
The ATM Simulator project is a Java-based application designed to mimic the functionalities of a real-world Automated Teller Machine (ATM).
<p>
   Developed using Java programming language, MySQL database, and Swing framework for the user interface, this project provides a simulated ATM environment where users can perform various banking operations.

User Authentication: The ATM Simulator requires users to authenticate themselves using a combination of a username and PIN (Personal Identification Number) before accessing their account.

Account Management: Users can perform typical banking operations such as checking their account balance, depositing funds, withdrawing cash, and transferring money between accounts.

Transaction History: The application maintains a transaction log, allowing users to view their recent transactions and track their account activity.

Security Measures: The ATM Simulator implements security measures to protect user data and transactions, including encryption techniques for sensitive information and session management to prevent unauthorized access.

GUI Interface: The user interface is designed using Swing, providing a visually appealing and user-friendly experience for interacting with the ATM functionalities.

Database Integration: The project utilizes MySQL as the backend database management system to store and manage user account details, transaction records, and other relevant information securely.

Error Handling: The application incorporates robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle exceptions, validate user inputs, and provide informative error messages to users when necessary.

Overall, the ATM Simulator project serves as an educational tool for learning about software development principles, Java programming, database management, and graphical user interface design while simulating real-world banking operations in a controlled environment.
